    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no correlation between Latitude and Humidity in either hemispheres. However, it's interesting to note that in both hemispheres, a majority of cities had higher humidity. My sampling has a lower number of cities in the southern hemisphere but by looking at the line of regression, we see the y-intercept is around 63F. This could be a result of climate change but further tests and sampling over time is required to confirm this.\n",

    "* There is no correlation between Latitude and Cloudiness in either hemispheres. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no correlation between Latitude and Wind Speed in either hemispheres. A majority of the wind speeds in both hemispheres were below 15 mph, probably because we are close to the end of the hurricane/cyclone season.\n",
